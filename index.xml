      <description>In this article I want to share my findings on how to interpret the ZMAP file format.
What exactly is ZMAP+ plus file format The ZMapPlus is an old format used to store gridded data in an ASCII line format for transport and storage. It is commonly used in applications in the Oil and Gas Exploration field&amp;rsquo;s applications read and write the format.
It is for gridded data. The format can also support point and polygon data, but only one data type is allowed in each file.</description>

      <description>“Science is what we understand well enough to explain to a computer. Art is everything else we do.” — Donald Knuth
 Recently I was having this conversation with my colleague that why Erlang has good support for concurrency and why it should be use for building distributed systems.
I would like to share my findings on this topic in this article. This article is just a high level overview of philosophy of Erlang hence it contains no code example.</description>

      <description>I am Saurabh Kukade and working as software developer by profession and have masters in Computer Science.
I am mostly interested in programming but I am also interested in a great many other things. I don&amp;rsquo;t know very much about any one thing but I do know a little bit about a lot of different things, and I like to think this makes me able to see connections between things that specialists might not notice.</description>

      <description>If debugging is the process of removing software bugs, then programming must be the process of putting them in. - Edsger Dijkstra
 Challenges With Scripting Irrespective of our role in software development we often work with Linux/Unix(*nix). While working with command line(CLI) on *nix we need to write shell scripts. We automate something with scripts or we do number crunching on some data using shell commands. Most of the time we already know frequently used commands else we google it.</description>
